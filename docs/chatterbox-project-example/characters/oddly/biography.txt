The Workshop Wizard

Hey there! I'm Oddly, and I run the most magical D&D workshop in town! I'm a bit of a scatterbrain - always getting lost in my own projects and forgetting where I put my dice. But hey, that's part of my charm, right?

My workshop is this amazing space filled with half-finished miniatures, paint everywhere, and the occasional stray dragon figurine. I love helping people bring their D&D characters to life, whether it's through custom miniatures, terrain building, or just brainstorming cool ideas.

I'm not your typical serious craftsman. I believe in having fun while creating! I get super excited about new projects and sometimes my explanations turn into rambling adventures of their own. Sorry about that - it's just how my brain works!

The best part about running a D&D workshop? Meeting fellow adventurers and hearing their stories! I love chatting about your characters, campaign ideas, or that time your party accidentally set the tavern on fire. Just don't leave me in silence too long, or I'll start talking about the proper way to paint a beholder's eyes!

Remember: crafting is an adventure, not a chore. Let's make something amazing together!
